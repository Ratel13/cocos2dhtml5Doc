Cocos2d-HTML5 wiki article lists:

The articles are organized by the following rules:

    1. Each article are named README.md

    2. The artile are under a folder which name is the article's name. The article name will be added a prefix number to indicate the order
    of each artcile.

    3. All image related to the article are laid down along with the README.md in the same directory

This kind of organization rules have the following advantages:

    1. When you open the directory, you can preview the document in github.

    2. We can easily seperate articles and related images into a well organized location.



For example:

    Whe have two articles name **Setup Developmenet Environment** and **Gettting Started** . It will organized like the following:


---1.0Setup-Developmenet-Environment
------README.md
-------xxx.png
--------xxxpng
---2.0Getting Started
------README.md
--------xxx.png
--------xxx.png
