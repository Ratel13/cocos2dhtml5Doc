The articles are organized by the following rules:

1. Each article are named README.md

2. The artile are under a folder which name is the article's name 

3. All image related to the article are laid down along with the README.md in the same directory

This kind of organization rules have the following advantages:

1. When you open the directory, you can preview the document in github.

2. We can easily seperate articles and related images into a well organized location.
